Feel free to do online research to answer these questions. But if you do, be sure to cite your source with your answer. A URL is sufficient.

1. How can Jarnik's algorithm be re-configured to find the maximum-spanning-tree instead of the minimum-spanning-tree?
- It can find the maximum-spanning-tree instead of the minimum-spanning-tree by changing the code to where the rule is to look at all turns/points/edges to connect the tree

2. How is a minimum-spanning-tree different from a solution to The Traveling Salesman problem?
- the traveling salesman problem creates so many cycles to find the shortest route compared to the minimun spanning tree where is has o cycles forming trees all around 


3. Rewrite 5 vertices from the weighted graph cityGraph2 from tests.py in adjacency matrix form. You can enter a text table yourself in your answers file, or copy and paste a text table from https://www.tablesgenerator.com/text_tables or add an additional image/spreadsheet file to your repository or put a link in question 3 to a Google Sheet. It's your call.


4. What is the Big-O time complexity of Jarnik's algorithm when a priority queue (binary heap) is used? What about when it is not used? Why is there a difference?

- O(v^2) or O(E log V)

5. Why is Jarnik's algorithm a greedy algorithm?
- It is a greedy algorithm because it tries to take all the steps possible to connect but it will use lots of different spots forming the tree without actually looking for the best spot. 


6. Jarnik's algorithm is commonly known as Prim's algorithm, even though Jarnik discovered it and published it decades before Prim rediscovered it. Research another algorithm that has a different common name from its original discoverer. What is the purpose of the algorithm and why did its original creator not get credit? 
- Another is Gaussian elimation algorithm. This algorithm is used to solve systems of linear equations and taking out variables step by atep usung matrix row operations. This algorithm was used way before Carl Friedrich Gauss had it but he was the one to make it popular in the world and thats how his name is on the algorithm.
